### Project 1. Predicting Walmart Sales

Predicting the weekly sales of 45 different Walmart Stores, based on data from 2010 - 2012.
The factors considered include:
* The average air temperature in the region
* The cost of fuel in the region
* That week's consumer price index
* The unemployment rate in the region
* Whether a holiday occured in that week
* (engineered) the month the week happened in
* (engineered) the week's number within the month

The main goal of this project is to predict the weekly sales of any of the Walmart stores considered, using regression models, but, an additional task could involve the prediction of the store based on the sales and other factors
