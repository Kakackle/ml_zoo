# ML ZOO

A collection of Machine Learning projects, used for learning and exploration, on interesting topics, learning through fun

### Project 1. Predicting Walmart Sales

Predicting the weekly sales of 45 different Walmart Stores, based on data from 2010 - 2012.
The factors considered include:
* The average air temperature in the region
* The cost of fuel in the region
* That week's consumer price index
* The unemployment rate in the region
* Whether a holiday occured in that week
* (engineered) the month the week happened in
* (engineered) the week's number within the month

The main goal of this project is to predict the weekly sales of any of the Walmart stores considered, using regression models, but, an additional task could involve the prediction of the store based on the sales and other factors

See the notebook with project results and the development process described in depth in a nice, viewable format: [Notebook Viewer](https://kakackle.github.io/ml_zoo/predicting_walmart_sales.html)


### Project 2. Spotify data and more for song genre classification and song recommendations
#### Song recommendation
* Start with basic song data
* Test out multiple approaches - cosine similarity, KNN
* Try to incorporate lyrics data
* Try to incorporate more metadata
* Try to incorporate user playlist data / collaborative filtering / etc

#### Genre classification
* or key classification
* or song stat regression (as in how joyful is a song likely to be from an artist, in a key, with a bpm, from a year)

### Project 3. Obesity or stroke risk prediction, one of these two

### Project 4. SPAM or something classification

### Project 5. Sign Language Recognition

### Project 6. Determine if producs in photos are the same

### Project 7. Multi-objective recommender system for stores?

### Project 8. Rossman store sales (or other store) prediction with significantly different factors than project 1
